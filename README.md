Project Name: ZoologyAI
Purpose: Image Recognition using, Convoluted Neural Networks

Debrief: 
  --> This program has been developed using the programming language Python, and some commonly used libraries such as Keras and Tensorflow. 

Training: 
  --> The AI model was trained for a total of 32 epochs and using approximately ~18,000 images from an open source website - Kaggle. Once the training was done, the model was saved in an .h5 file. 

Preprocessing: 
  --> When testing the model, the image fed to the algorithm will be modified graphically allow for a more accurate prediction.

How to use the program: 
  --> Create a test.py file that accept an image. Load the model and feed the /imagepath to the algorithm and watch the magic happen!
